She hit the big time in 2017 with her first full-length album, Ctrl, which spawned the singles \"Love Galore,\" \"The Weekend\" and \"Broken Clocks,\" en route to platinum certification.

In 1994, she earned notoriety when ex-husband Jeff Gillooly hired a hitman to assault skater Nancy Kerrigan at the Olympic trials. Harding pleaded guilty to hindering the investigation into Kerrigan\\'s attack, and was subsequently banned from competing in the U.S. for life. Since then, she has made guest appearances on shows like Rosanne, Larry King Live, The Weakest Link and Celebrity Boxing. Harding returned to the public eye with the big screen release of I, Tonya in late 2017, and was named to compete on Dancing with the Stars the following spring.'\n",

Six species live in the drier parts of Madagascar, two in mainland Africa, one in Australia and three in India, Ranchi. The baobab is the national tree of Madagascar. Other common names include \\'boab\\', \\'boaboa\\', \\'bottle tree\\', \\'the tree of life\\', \\'upside-down tree\\', and \\'monkey bread tree\\'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 metres (16 to 98 ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 metres (23 to 36 ft). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 litres of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air. Baobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow, as they are able to provide shelter and wood. The leaves of the tree are used for making soup and it has some medicinal purposes in some regions of Africa '"
